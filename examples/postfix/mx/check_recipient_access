# It might happen you get truckloads of spam on e.g. the postmaster account of a
# specific mail domain you're handling mail for. In that case, reject mail with
# a logical message which will tell the other person where to try instead to
# report the problem.
#

# Too much spam...
postmaster@example.net		554 Rejected - please send postmaster mail to postmaster at example.com instead.

# No need to check the domain names here, reject_unauth_destination just did
# that for us. (well, only if you have configured check_recipient_access after
# reject_unauth_destination of course. :-) )
